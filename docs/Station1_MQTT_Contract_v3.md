# PPNAM Station 1 - Scanner MQTT Contract

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Contract version | 3.3.0 |
| Status | Normative Station 1 scanner contract |
| Last updated | 2026-09-18 |
| Target client | PPNAM Station 1 Android handheld scanners (any number; no fixed roles) |
| Topic structure | Fleet-wide namespaced structure per `C:\Dev\Clients\PPNAM\MQTT_TOPIC_STRUCTURE.md` |
| Authentication schema | `"4.1"` (shared Station 2 authority) |
| Workflow QoS | `1`, retain `false` |
| Presence | Retained `online`/`offline` + Last Will on base topic nodes, QoS 2 |

This contract defines everything a Station 1 Android scanner and the Station 1 Windows
backend exchange over MQTT: presence, schema 4.1 authentication, and the two scanner
workflows — **Tag Assignment** and **Offload**. The desktop remains authoritative for all
other receiving business state.

Version 3.0.0 replaces the 2.x receiving contract with the stripped-down scanner model:

- Scanners have **no fixed roles**. Any scanner can perform any workflow its signed-in
  operator is permitted; permissions come from the login response and are enforced on the
  scanner by what it offers and sends. The station additionally authorizes every request
  server-side.
- Device ids are **derived unique ids**, not configured reader numbers.
- All topics use the fleet-wide namespaced structure; presence and Last Will live on base
  topic nodes.
- The 2.x receiving message families (desktop-targeted assignment, staged offload,
  discrepancy gates, SAP/print flows, broadcasts) are **removed** — see Section 9.

The words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are normative.

## 1. Topic structure, subscriptions, and transport

All topics are lowercase and case-sensitive, under the fleet-wide structure
(`C:\Dev\Clients\PPNAM\MQTT_TOPIC_STRUCTURE.md`):

```text
PPNAM/station_1                                station presence (retained online/offline + LWT)
PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}                     scanner presence (retained online/offline + LWT)
PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/{requestType}   scanner -> station request
PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/res/{responseType}  station -> scanner response
```

There is **no `/status` sub-topic** — presence is the retained payload on the base node
itself. `res` directly under the station (`PPNAM/station_1/res/...`) is a reserved
broadcast tree; version 3.0.0 defines no broadcast messages, and scanners MUST tolerate
(ignore) unknown messages there.

Subscriptions:

| Participant | Subscribes to | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Station backend | `PPNAM/station_1/+` | scanner presence |
| Station backend | `PPNAM/station_1/+/req/+` | all scanner requests (auth + workflow) |
| Scanner | `PPNAM/station_1` | station presence |
| Scanner | `PPNAM/station_1/{ownDeviceId}/res/+` | all of its responses, `request_rejected` included |

Transport rules:

| Setting | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Encoding | One UTF-8 JSON object per message. |
| Workflow QoS / retain | QoS 1, retain `false`. |
| Presence QoS / retain | QoS 2, retain `true`; raw text `online` or `offline`. |
| Timestamps | UTC ISO 8601 ending in `Z`. Authentication timestamps use exactly six fractional digits (`yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.ffffff'Z'`). |
| Property names | Lower-camel case, case-sensitive as shown. |
| Topic segments | A `deviceId` or request/response type never contains `/`, `+`, or `#`; both sides reject violations loudly. |
| Broker credentials | Transport-only; configured externally, never placed in JSON payloads. |

## 2. Device identity

`deviceId` is the scanner's **derived unique id**: `scanner_` followed by the first 12 hex
characters of SHA-256 of a per-device identifier (Wi-Fi MAC, falling back to `ANDROID_ID`
where Android withholds the MAC), e.g. `scanner_5c64df8d86a8`. It is generated once on the
device, persisted, and shown in the app's Settings → Diagnostics for enrolment.

- The station MUST treat device ids as **opaque case-sensitive strings** with a `scanner_`
  prefix — never as numbers, and never as role identifiers.
- The fixed identities `scanner_1` / `scanner_2` and the Reader 1 / Reader 2 role split
  are **retired**. Station-side validation MUST NOT require a device to match a configured
  `Reader1DeviceId`/`Reader2DeviceId` pair; where deployments want an allow-list, it is an
  enrolment list of derived ids, not a role binding.
- The topic `deviceId` segment and the payload `deviceId` MUST match exactly on every
  request.
- Each physical scanner uses a unique MQTT client id (transport identity, distinct from
  `deviceId`).

## 3. Sessions and permissions

An operator signs in on the scanner (Section 4). The accepted login response carries
`allowedTabs` — the workflows this operator may use. For Station 1 the defined values are:

```json
"allowedTabs": ["tag_assignment", "offload"]
```

either value alone, or both.

- The station MUST send `allowedTabs` explicitly on every accepted login; the scanner
  enables exactly the listed workflows and treats a missing or empty list as **no
  workflows enabled** (fail closed).
- Enforcement is on the scanner: it only offers, and only sends, requests for allowed
  workflows. The station additionally rejects a workflow request whose operator session
  does not permit it (`ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED`) — scanner-side gating is UX, not security.
- Every workflow request carries the `operatorSessionId` returned by login. Requests with
  a missing, expired, closed, or other-device session are rejected
  (`AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` / `OPERATOR_SESSION_INVALID`).

## 4. Schema 4.1 authentication and authorization

Station 1 does not define its own login protocol: the authentication, operator-session,
replay, credential-storage, and response-correlation rules are the shared Station 2 schema
4.1 contract (source authority: Station 2 repository `RFID_MQTT_CONTRACT.md` and
`DOCS/Deployment/SCHEMA_4_1_ANDROID_BROKER_HANDOFF.md`). If wording here conflicts with
the Station 2 authority for a shared behavior, Station 2 wins; this document wins for
Station 1 workflow behavior.

Request/response pairs, on the namespaced topics of Section 1:

| Request `req/{type}` | Response `res/{type}` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `scram_start_requested` | `scram_challenge` | Start password login (or a Manager/Admin scoped authorization). |
| `scram_proof_requested` | `scram_proof_result` | Prove password knowledge; receive the operator session. |
| `login_requested` | `operator_context` | Badge login. |
| `operator_list_requested` | `operator_list` | Login-screen operator directory (3.2.0). |
| `reader_logout_requested` | `operator_context` | Close this device's session. |

Envelope and routing failures are published to
`PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/res/request_rejected`; scanners subscribe to the full `res/+`
wildcard, never only the success suffixes.

### 4.1 Authentication request envelope

Every schema 4.1 authentication request contains:

```json
{
  "messageId": "auth-operation-id",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:00.000000Z",
  "correlationKey": "optional-trace-reference"
}
```

Rules:

- `operatorSessionId` is omitted before login and required for signed-in requests such as
  reader logout.
- Omit unused optional fields; normal requests do not send `null` or empty values.
- `messageId` identifies one logical operation, not a delivery attempt. Duplicate identity
  is `(deviceId, requestType, messageId)`.
- An uncertain request is retried with the identical topic and exact UTF-8 body. Do not
  reserialize the JSON, reorder properties, change whitespace, or refresh the timestamp on
  retry. Reusing the identity with a different raw body returns `message_id_reused`
  without a mutation.

Station 1 envelope validation:

| Input | Exact rule |
|---|---|
| Topic | Exactly five segments: `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/{requestType}`. `PPNAM`, `station_1`, and `req` use this exact case. |
| `requestType` | Lowercase supported suffix, maximum 100 characters, no control characters. |
| `messageId` | Required, maximum 128 characters, no control characters. |
| `schemaVersion` | Exact case-sensitive value `"4.1"`. |
| `deviceId` | Required, maximum 100 characters, exact case-sensitive match to the topic device; no whitespace, control characters, `/`, `+`, or `#`. |
| Device acceptance | Opaque `scanner_`-prefixed id (Section 2). Optional deployment enrolment list of derived ids; no reader-role matching. |
| `correlationKey` | Optional, maximum 250 characters, no control characters. |
| `timestampUtc` | Exact format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.ffffff'Z'`. Default accepted age 15 minutes, default future skew 2 minutes; deployment settings may adjust within server bounds. |
| JSON properties | Lower-camel names as shown. Duplicate property names (case-insensitive, any depth) are rejected. |
| Sensitive names | `password` or `managerPassword` anywhere in the JSON tree is rejected before dispatch (`plaintext_credentials_forbidden`). |

### 4.2 Authentication response envelope

Every direct schema 4.1 authentication response contains:

```json
{
  "messageId": "response-auth-operation-id",
  "inResponseToMessageId": "auth-operation-id",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "operatorSessionId": "session-id-when-applicable",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:00.100000Z",
  "serverReceivedAtUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:00.000000Z",
  "serverSentAtUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:00.100000Z",
  "processingDurationMs": 100,
  "accepted": true,
  "reason": "SCRAM challenge issued.",
  "nextAction": "stable_scanner_action"
}
```

For a normally processed request, response `messageId` is exactly
`response-{request.messageId}`. `errorCode`, `errorMessage`, and optional result
properties are omitted when null; the Android decoder MUST tolerate absent optional
properties. The scanner branches on `accepted`, `errorCode`, and `nextAction`, correlates
with `inResponseToMessageId`, deduplicates responses by response `messageId`, and never
treats `nextAction` as authorization.

Stable `nextAction` values in 3.0.0: `submit_scram_proof`, `login`, `start_scram`,
`restart_scram`, `retry`, and `workflow_selection` (an accepted login: proceed to the
`allowedTabs`-gated workflow selection; replaces 2.x `active_receiving_sessions`, which
retires with receiving sessions). `submit_scoped_action` is reserved with Section 4.6.
Scanner behavior is driven by `nextAction`, never by parsing free-text `reason`.

### 4.3 SCRAM-SHA-256 password login

Start request on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/scram_start_requested`:

```json
{
  "messageId": "auth-start-001",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:00.000000Z",
  "username": "operator1",
  "clientNonce": "cryptographically-random-nonce",
  "purpose": "login"
}
```

The `scram_challenge` response adds `challengeId`, `serverNonce`, base64 `salt`,
`iterations`, `serverFirstMessage`, `expiresAtUtc`, and
`nextAction: "submit_scram_proof"`. A challenge expires 60 seconds after issue and is
one-use.

Proof request on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/scram_proof_requested`:

```json
{
  "messageId": "auth-proof-001",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:01.000000Z",
  "challengeId": "challenge-id",
  "clientFinalWithoutProof": "c=biws,r=combined-server-nonce",
  "clientProof": "base64-proof",
  "purpose": "login"
}
```

The `scram_proof_result` adds `serverSignature`, operator identity, role,
`allowedActions`, `allowedTabs`, `operatorSessionId`, `sessionState`,
`sessionExpiresAtUtc`, and `nextAction`. The scanner MUST validate `serverSignature`
(constant-time compare) before accepting the session.

Android derives and validates the proof exactly as follows:

1. Normalize the password with Unicode NFKC, then encode it as UTF-8.
2. Base64-decode the response `salt`.
3. Compute `saltedPassword = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256(passwordBytes, saltBytes, iterations, 32 bytes)`.
4. Compute `clientKey = HMAC-SHA-256(saltedPassword, UTF8("Client Key"))`.
5. Compute `storedKey = SHA-256(clientKey)`.
6. Escape the username for SCRAM by replacing `=` with `=3D` and `,` with `=2C`.
7. Recreate `clientFirstBare = "n={escapedUsername},r={originalClientNonce}"`.
8. Use the returned `serverFirstMessage` exactly as sent.
9. Create `clientFinalWithoutProof = "c=biws,r={serverNonce}"`.
10. Create `authMessage = clientFirstBare + "," + serverFirstMessage + "," + clientFinalWithoutProof`.
11. Compute `clientSignature = HMAC-SHA-256(storedKey, UTF8(authMessage))`.
12. XOR the 32 bytes of `clientKey` and `clientSignature`, then standard-Base64 encode the result as `clientProof`.
13. Compute `serverKey = HMAC-SHA-256(saltedPassword, UTF8("Server Key"))`.
14. Compute `expectedServerSignature = Base64(HMAC-SHA-256(serverKey, UTF8(authMessage)))`.
15. After an accepted proof response, compare `expectedServerSignature` to response `serverSignature` in constant time. If it does not match, discard the response and session.

The client nonce is trimmed, contains no comma, is at most 200 characters, and comes from
a cryptographically secure random generator. The proof request MUST repeat the exact
`purpose` (and scope fields, where used) from the challenge.

Representative accepted login proof result:

```json
{
  "messageId": "response-auth-proof-001",
  "inResponseToMessageId": "auth-proof-001",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "operatorSessionId": "reader-session-id",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:01.100000Z",
  "serverReceivedAtUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:01.000000Z",
  "serverSentAtUtc": "2026-08-25T06:00:01.100000Z",
  "processingDurationMs": 100,
  "correlationKey": "challenge-id",
  "accepted": true,
  "reason": "SCRAM proof accepted.",
  "nextAction": "workflow_selection",
  "serverSignature": "base64-server-signature",
  "operatorId": "user-id",
  "displayName": "Operator One",
  "username": "operator1",
  "role": "Operator",
  "roleLabel": "Operator",
  "allowedActions": [],
  "allowedTabs": ["tag_assignment", "offload"],
  "sessionState": "Active",
  "sessionExpiresAtUtc": "2026-08-25T22:00:01.000000Z"
}
```

`allowedTabs` on a scanner login carries the Section 3 workflow values only. (Desktop tab
names from desktop sign-in do not appear on scanner logins.)

### 4.4 Badge login and reader logout

Badge login on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/login_requested`:

```json
{
  "messageId": "badge-login-001",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-08-25T06:05:00.000000Z",
  "badgeTag": "TAG-JSMITH"
}
```

The `operator_context` response contains acceptance, operator identity, role,
`allowedActions`, `allowedTabs` (Section 3 values), session state/expiry, and the new
`operatorSessionId`. The handler accepts only an active row in
`station1_operator_badges`; badges are provisioned separately from desktop users. An
accepted badge context uses `nextAction: "workflow_selection"`; a rejected one uses
`accepted: false`, `errorCode: "badge_rejected"`, and `nextAction: "login"`.

`reader_logout_requested` uses the signed-in envelope with no additional request fields.
An accepted `operator_context` logout response has `operatorSessionId: ""`,
`sessionState: "Closed"`, and `nextAction: "login"`; it closes only the session bound to
that exact device. A replay returns the stored already-closed context without closing the
session twice.

### 4.5 Operator directory (added in 3.2.0)

The login screen offers a dropdown of operator usernames so an operator picks a name and
types only the password. The scanner asks for the directory whenever it (re)connects to
the broker while on the login screen, on
`PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/operator_list_requested` with the plain pre-login
envelope and no additional fields:

```json
{
  "messageId": "operator-list-001",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-09-17T06:00:00.000000Z"
}
```

The station answers on `res/operator_list`:

```json
{
  "messageId": "response-operator-list-001",
  "inResponseToMessageId": "operator-list-001",
  "schemaVersion": "4.1",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "timestampUtc": "2026-09-17T06:00:00.120000Z",
  "accepted": true,
  "reason": "Operator list.",
  "nextAction": "login",
  "operators": [
    { "username": "jsmith", "displayName": "J. Smith" }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- `operators` lists **active password (SCRAM) operators** only, sorted by `displayName`.
  Each entry carries exactly `username` and `displayName`. Roles, permissions,
  `allowedTabs`, badge tags, and secrets MUST NOT appear — the directory is display-only
  and confers nothing; every login is still authenticated by §4.3 / §4.4.
- No `operatorSessionId` is required. Replay follows §4.7 (an identical replay returns the
  stored list).
- The scanner caches the last accepted list on the device so the dropdown is populated
  before the station answers (or when it never does). Typing a username that is not in the
  list remains valid.
- A station that has not implemented this request rejects it with
  `authentication_request_unsupported` on `res/request_rejected` (§4.1); the scanner then
  keeps its cached list, or an empty dropdown, and falls back to typed usernames.

### 4.6 Manager/Admin scoped authorization (reserved)

The schema 4.1 SCRAM exchange also supports `purpose: "manager_action"` with
`actionTarget`/`managerAction`, returning a one-use, 60-second, device/target/action-bound
`authorizationToken` (stored server-side only as a hash). The mechanism is implemented at
the authentication boundary, but **version 3.0.0 defines no scanner workflow that consumes
a scoped token** — the stripped workflows in Sections 5-6 are Operator actions. The
mechanism is reserved for future privileged scanner actions; until one is defined,
scanners MUST NOT expose a Manager/Admin scanner flow.

### 4.7 Replay and idempotency (authentication)

Station 1 stores `(messageId, requestType, deviceId)`, the request-body hash, correlation
metadata, response route, and a replay-safe serialized result in
`station1_processed_mqtt_messages`:

1. New identity: validate and execute.
2. Same identity + same body while processing: return/await the same logical outcome; no
   second mutation.
3. Same identity + same body after commit: replay the stored result.
4. Same identity + changed body: reject (`message_id_reused`) and audit; do not execute.
5. A token-bearing result is exact-replayable only from its bounded memory cache; after
   restart/cache loss the same retry gets `authorization_reauthentication_required`
   without a second token or proof mutation.

## 5. Workflow: Tag Assignment

The operator opens Tag Assignment (permitted by `allowedTabs`) and scans RFID tags. The
scanner sends each scanned tag automatically; the station decides what the tag means and
answers success or failure. No document context, no product selection, no desktop-targeted
rows on the scanner.

Request on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/tag_scan` (sent automatically on every scan):

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T08:15:30.125Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "operatorSessionId": "reader-session-id",
  "tagId": "E280689400005015ABCD1234"
}
```

Response on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/res/tag_scan_result`:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T08:15:30.180Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "tagId": "E280689400005015ABCD1234",
  "accepted": true,
  "reason": "Tag assigned.",
  "errorCode": null
}
```

Rules:

- The station MUST answer every `tag_scan` with a `tag_scan_result` echoing the same
  `tagId` (the scanner correlates on it). `accepted: false` carries a stable `errorCode`
  (Section 7) and a sanitized operator-readable `reason`.
- Re-scanning the same tag is a new request; the station answers each one (idempotently —
  a tag already assigned by this scan reports success, a tag assigned elsewhere reports
  `TAG_ALREADY_IN_USE`).
- The scanner SHOULD show a pending state until the result arrives and SHOULD surface a
  timeout after 10 seconds without one. A PUBACK is transport-only and never shown as
  business success.

## 6. Workflow: Offload

The operator opens Offload (permitted by `allowedTabs`) and scans a pallet's RFID tag and
a barcode. The scanner sends the pair; the station validates the match and, when valid,
returns the pallet's expected packaging values — `bagWeight`, `bagCount`,
`batchReference` — as prefill, together with the open document the pallet belongs to — an
open purchase order or an open stock transfer request (Section 6.1). The scanner is
**never locked** to a document: the document number is per-pallet metadata from the
tag + barcode lookup, and the scanner simply repeats it on that pallet's confirm and,
should the operator close, on the completion.

The operator may edit any of the three prefill values, then confirms; the scanner sends
the final values (unchanged values are sent back verbatim) and the station answers with
the committed result and updated pallet progress. After each accepted confirm the scanner
asks whether the operator is done; when they are, they close the document from that
pallet's lookup with a Short / Complete / Over classification (Section 6.4) and the
scanner returns to scanning.

### 6.1 Document resolution (added in 3.1.0)

The scanner never pre-selects, requests, or locks a document. Every `offload_scan`
carries only the tag and barcode; the station resolves the scanned pallet, and every
matched `offload_scan_result` carries the open document that pallet belongs to as four
plain top-level fields — no sub-object:

```json
"documentType": "purchase_order",
"documentNumber": "PO-000123",
"palletsScanned": 5,
"palletsExpected": 12
```

The document number only becomes available to the scanner through this lookup — it is
never scanner-side state or operator entry. The scanner displays it and repeats the
reference on that pallet's `offload_confirm` and on an `offload_complete`.

Rules:

- `documentType` is exactly `"purchase_order"` or `"stock_transfer"`; `documentNumber` is
  the PO number / stock transfer number. Supplier, warehouse, date, and status details
  stay desktop-side — the scanner does not receive or display them.
- `palletsScanned` and `palletsExpected` are integers — pallets already offloaded against
  the document (not counting the just-scanned, not-yet-confirmed one) and the total the
  backend expects for it.
- The resolved document is always one the station considers open for receiving at this
  station; a pallet that resolves to no open document is a failed match
  (`DOCUMENT_UNKNOWN`).
- The reference travels on `offload_confirm` and `offload_complete` as the pair
  `"documentType"` + `"documentNumber"`, repeated verbatim from the scan result.
  `offload_scan` itself never carries document fields. A missing reference where required
  is rejected with `DOCUMENT_REQUIRED`; one that does not resolve to an open document with
  `DOCUMENT_UNKNOWN`; a confirm whose pallet does not belong to the referenced document
  with `DOCUMENT_MISMATCH`.

### 6.2 Scan step

Request on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/offload_scan` — tag and barcode only, never a
document reference:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T09:10:00.000Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "operatorSessionId": "reader-session-id",
  "tagId": "E280689400005015ABCD1234",
  "barcode": "BC-000123"
}
```

Response on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/res/offload_scan_result` — every matched result
carries the pallet's resolved document:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T09:10:00.090Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "tagId": "E280689400005015ABCD1234",
  "barcode": "BC-000123",
  "matched": true,
  "reason": "Tag and barcode match.",
  "errorCode": null,
  "bagWeight": 25.0,
  "bagCount": 40,
  "batchReference": "BATCH-2026-0815",
  "documentType": "purchase_order",
  "documentNumber": "PO-000123",
  "palletsScanned": 5,
  "palletsExpected": 12
}
```

- `matched: true` MUST include all three prefill values and the four document fields
  (Section 6.1), whose `palletsScanned`/`palletsExpected` give the document's progress. A
  pallet that resolves to no open document is `matched: false` with `DOCUMENT_UNKNOWN`.
- `matched: false` carries a stable `errorCode` (e.g. `PAIR_MISMATCH`,
  `BARCODE_NOT_FOUND`, `TAG_ALREADY_OFFLOADED`, `DOCUMENT_UNKNOWN`) and omits the prefill
  and document fields; the scanner returns to scanning.
- `bagWeight` is a JSON number (kilograms), `bagCount` a positive JSON integer,
  `batchReference` a string.

### 6.3 Confirm step

Request on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/offload_confirm`, sent after the operator
reviews/edits the values (unchanged values are repeated verbatim):

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T09:11:05.000Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "operatorSessionId": "reader-session-id",
  "documentType": "purchase_order",
  "documentNumber": "PO-000123",
  "tagId": "E280689400005015ABCD1234",
  "barcode": "BC-000123",
  "bagWeight": 24.5,
  "bagCount": 40,
  "batchReference": "BATCH-2026-0815"
}
```

Response on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/res/offload_confirm_result`:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T09:11:05.110Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "tagId": "E280689400005015ABCD1234",
  "barcode": "BC-000123",
  "accepted": true,
  "reason": "Offload recorded.",
  "errorCode": null,
  "palletsScanned": 6,
  "palletsExpected": 12
}
```

An accepted confirm MUST include the updated progress: `palletsScanned` now **includes**
the just-committed pallet; the scanner shows it (e.g. "6 of 12") on the done prompt.

Rules:

- The confirm is self-contained: it carries the tag, barcode, the document reference from
  that pallet's scan result, and the final values, and the station re-validates the pair
  and the pallet's document membership at confirm time (`DOCUMENT_MISMATCH` when the
  pallet does not belong to the referenced document). There is no server-side pairing
  context the scanner must keep alive between scan and confirm.
- The station MUST be idempotent on a re-sent identical confirm for an already-committed
  offload: reply `accepted: true` again without a second mutation. A confirm for a pallet
  offloaded with **different** values, or offloaded from another scan, is rejected with
  `TAG_ALREADY_OFFLOADED`.
- Value validation failures use `INVALID_BAG_WEIGHT`, `INVALID_BAG_COUNT`, or
  `BATCH_REFERENCE_REQUIRED`; the scanner keeps the operator on the edit screen.
- Timeout guidance as in Section 5: pending state, 10-second timeout, PUBACK is not
  success.

### 6.4 Document completion (Short / Complete / Over) — added in 3.1.0

After every accepted confirm the scanner asks whether the operator is done. When they are,
they classify the receipt and the scanner closes the document from that pallet's
tag + barcode lookup — the scanner already holds the reference because the scan result
carried it (Section 6.1); nothing was selected or locked beforehand.

Request on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/req/offload_complete`:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T09:20:00.000Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "operatorSessionId": "reader-session-id",
  "documentType": "purchase_order",
  "documentNumber": "PO-000123",
  "status": "complete"
}
```

`status` MUST be exactly one of the lowercase values:

| Value | Meaning | Tag count field |
|---|---|---|
| `short` | Operator is done; fewer goods were received than expected. | `shortTagCount`, required |
| `complete` | Operator is done; the receipt matches expectations. | none; both fields absent |
| `over` | Operator is done; more goods were received than expected. | `overTagCount`, required |

#### Tag counts on a short or over close (added in 3.3.0)

A short or over close also declares **how many tags the receipt differs by**. The operator
picks Short Tags or Over Tags, is asked "How many tags short?" (or over), enters a whole
number of 1 or more, and submits. The count rides on the same `offload_complete` in the
field matching its status:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-09-18T09:20:00.000Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "operatorSessionId": "reader-session-id",
  "documentType": "purchase_order",
  "documentNumber": "PO-000123",
  "status": "short",
  "shortTagCount": 3
}
```

Rules for the count:

- It is a JSON integer of **1 or more**. The scanner refuses 0, negatives, decimals, and
  blanks locally and never sends them.
- The field MUST match the status: `shortTagCount` with `short`, `overTagCount` with
  `over`. The station rejects a count sent under the other status with
  `INVALID_TAG_COUNT`, and a short/over close with no count at all with
  `TAG_COUNT_REQUIRED`.
- A `complete` close carries **neither** field. A count alongside `complete` contradicts
  the classification and is rejected with `INVALID_TAG_COUNT`.
- The accepted result echoes the count back in the same field, so an idempotent replay
  returns the originally recorded number.
- The count is the operator's declaration of the discrepancy. What the station does with
  it — reconciliation, SAP posting, discrepancy handling — is desktop authority and stays
  out of MQTT scope.

Response on `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}/res/offload_complete_result`:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-08-25T09:20:00.080Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "status": "complete",
  "accepted": true,
  "reason": "Receipt closed.",
  "errorCode": null
}
```

A short or over result echoes its count as well:

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-09-18T09:20:00.080Z",
  "deviceId": "scanner_5c64df8d86a8",
  "status": "short",
  "shortTagCount": 3,
  "accepted": true,
  "reason": "Receipt closed.",
  "errorCode": null
}
```

Rules:

- The station MUST answer every `offload_complete` with an `offload_complete_result`
  echoing the same `status` (the scanner correlates on it). `accepted: false` carries a
  stable `errorCode` and a sanitized operator-readable `reason`.
- An unknown or missing `status` is rejected with `INVALID_PAYLOAD`; a missing or
  mismatched tag count with `TAG_COUNT_REQUIRED` / `INVALID_TAG_COUNT`. Session and
  permission failures use the standard codes (`AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED`,
  `OPERATOR_SESSION_INVALID`, `ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED` — the completion belongs to the
  `offload` workflow permission).
- The station MUST be idempotent on a re-sent identical completion for an
  already-closed document: reply `accepted: true` again without a second mutation.
- The completion closes only the referenced document and does not end the operator's
  session — the scanner returns to scanning afterwards. What the classification does to
  station-side business state (reconciliation, SAP posting, discrepancy handling) is
  desktop-authority, out of MQTT scope.
- Timeout guidance as in Section 5: pending state, 10-second timeout, PUBACK is not
  success.

## 7. Workflow envelope and error codes

Workflow messages (Sections 5-6) use the lightweight envelope shown above: `ts`,
`deviceId`, `operatorSessionId` on requests; `ts`, `deviceId`, and the echoed correlating
fields (`tagId`, `barcode` for the offload pair steps, and `status` for
`offload_complete`) on responses. Workflow messages do not carry
`messageId`, `schemaVersion`, `workflowRevision`, `sessionId`, or `stateVersion` — those
belong to the schema 4.1 authentication envelope and the retired 2.x receiving contract
respectively.

Authentication error codes (lowercase) are unchanged from 2.x — the implemented schema 4.1
set: `authentication_payload_invalid`, `authentication_request_unsupported`,
`authentication_unavailable`, `duplicate_json_property`, `message_id_required`,
`message_id_reused`, `schema_version_unsupported`, `device_id_mismatch`,
`rfid_settings_unavailable`, `rfid_settings_invalid`, `rfid_device_not_configured`,
`correlation_key_invalid`, `timestamp_invalid`, `timestamp_stale`, `timestamp_future`,
`plaintext_credentials_forbidden`, `login_method_invalid`, `badge_required`,
`badge_rejected`, `scram_start_invalid`, `scram_purpose_invalid`, `scram_scope_required`,
`scram_verifier_migration_required`, `scram_challenge_not_found`,
`scram_challenge_reused`, `scram_challenge_expired`, `scram_scope_mismatch`,
`scram_client_final_invalid`, `scram_proof_invalid`, `authentication_failed`,
`permission_denied`, `operator_session_invalid`,
`authorization_reauthentication_required`. Android compares them exactly.
(`rfid_device_not_configured` now means: not on the deployment's enrolment list, where one
is configured — see Section 2.)

Workflow error codes (uppercase), the complete 3.0.0 set:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `INVALID_PAYLOAD` | JSON/required field/type/format invalid. |
| `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` | No active operator session for this device. |
| `OPERATOR_SESSION_INVALID` | Session closed, expired, inactive, or bound to another device. |
| `ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED` | The operator's `allowedTabs` does not permit this workflow. |
| `TAG_REQUIRED` | RFID value missing/invalid. |
| `TAG_UNKNOWN` | Tag does not resolve to anything actionable at this station. |
| `TAG_ALREADY_IN_USE` | Active tag binding exists elsewhere (tag assignment). |
| `TAG_ALREADY_OFFLOADED` | This pallet/tag was already offloaded (offload scan or conflicting confirm). |
| `BARCODE_REQUIRED` | Barcode missing/invalid. |
| `BARCODE_NOT_FOUND` | Barcode does not resolve to an eligible pallet. |
| `PAIR_MISMATCH` | Tag and barcode resolve to different pallets. |
| `DOCUMENT_REQUIRED` | Document reference (`documentType`/`documentNumber`) missing or malformed on `offload_confirm`/`offload_complete`. |
| `DOCUMENT_UNKNOWN` | No open purchase order / stock transfer: a scanned pallet belongs to no open document, or a carried reference does not resolve. |
| `DOCUMENT_MISMATCH` | The confirm's pallet does not belong to the referenced document. |
| `INVALID_BAG_WEIGHT` | Bag weight is not a positive number in the allowed range. |
| `INVALID_BAG_COUNT` | Bag count is not a positive whole number in the allowed range. |
| `BATCH_REFERENCE_REQUIRED` | Batch reference missing/invalid. |
| `TAG_COUNT_REQUIRED` | A short or over completion arrived without its tag count (3.3.0). |
| `OVER_RECEIPT_PENDING_AUTHORISATION` | A first over-receipt close was recorded and is waiting for desktop Manager/Admin authorisation; the receipt stays open (3.3.0). |
| `INCOMPLETE_PALLETS` | A shortage was recorded, or an over-receipt was reported before every included pallet was offloaded; desktop resolution is pending. |
| `INVALID_TAG_COUNT` | Tag count is not a whole number of 1 or more, is sent under the wrong status, or rides along with `complete` (3.3.0). |
| `DATABASE_FAILED` | Station transaction did not commit; no success response exists. |
| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Sanitized unexpected station error. |

## 8. Presence and reconnect

| Participant | Topic | On connect | Last Will |
|---|---|---|---|
| Station backend | `PPNAM/station_1` | retained `online` (QoS 2) | retained `offline` on the same topic |
| Scanner | `PPNAM/station_1/{deviceId}` | retained `online` (QoS 2) | retained `offline` on the same topic |

On graceful shutdown each participant publishes retained `offline` itself; the Last Will
covers unclean disconnects. On reconnect: the station restores its two subscription
filters; a scanner restores `PPNAM/station_1/{ownDeviceId}/res/+` and `PPNAM/station_1`,
republishes retained `online`, and re-authenticates when its session is closed or expired.
Workflow state needs no resynchronization — both workflows are stateless request/response.

## 9. Removed from the 2.x contract

The following 2.x elements are retired and MUST NOT be implemented, subscribed, or
published by 3.0.0 clients or the station:

- **Old topic layout:** un-namespaced `PPNAM/{deviceId}/...` topics, all `/status`
  sub-topics, and bare three-segment command/result topics
  (`PPNAM/{reader}/assignment_v2`, `PPNAM/station_1/assignment_result`, ...).
- **Fixed identities and roles:** configured `scanner_1`/`scanner_2` device ids, the
  Scanner 1 / Scanner 2 role split, and `Reader1DeviceId`/`Reader2DeviceId` role matching.
- **Receiving message families:** `tag_assignment_request`, `assignment` /
  `assignment_v2`, `unassign`, `reassign` and their `*_result`s; `offload_start`, staged
  `offload_v2` (`ScanTag`/`ScanLabel`/`ConfirmPallet`), `offload_result`,
  `all_offloaded`, `all_offloaded_result`, and the scanner discrepancy reports; `sap`,
  `sap_products_request`, `sap_products_selected`, `sap_products_response`,
  `all_assigned`, `print_all`, `bag_weight`, `offload` (atomic legacy).
- **Envelope machinery:** `workflowRevision`, receiving `sessionId`, `stateVersion`,
  workflow `messageId`/outbox replay, the Section 13/14 workflow error/nextAction
  catalogues beyond the sets defined here, and the Scanner 1/Scanner 2 state machines.

Desktop-side processes those flows served (product selection, pallet planning, label
printing, SAP posting, reconciliation, discrepancy handling) are desktop-only and out of
MQTT scope.

## 10. Implementation deltas (as of 2026-08-25)

What each side must change to meet 3.0.0. Neither side should treat this contract as
describing current shipped behavior until these land:

*(3.3.0, 2026-09-18)* Short/over completion tag counts are implemented on the Android
scanner and the simulator; **the Windows station handler must accept and persist
`shortTagCount`/`overTagCount`** and enforce the two new error codes.

*(3.2.0, 2026-09-17)* `operator_list_requested` is implemented on the Android scanner and
the simulator; **the Windows station handler is pending** — until it ships, scanners receive
`authentication_request_unsupported` and fall back to typed usernames.

**Station 1 Windows backend:**

1. Authentication topic routing accepts only the retired four-segment
   `PPNAM/{deviceId}/req/{type}` shape (`RfidDeviceInitializer.TryProcessAuthenticationRequestAsync`)
   and replies on `PPNAM/{deviceId}/res/{type}` — must move to the Section 1 namespaced
   shape. The subscription list still contains the retired un-namespaced filters — prune
   to the two Section 1 filters.
2. Device validation (`RequireConfiguredDevice` → `Reader1DeviceId`/`Reader2DeviceId`)
   must be replaced per Section 2 (opaque derived ids; optional enrolment list).
3. `allowedTabs` on scanner logins must carry the Section 3 values
   (`tag_assignment`, `offload`) per operator permissions, and accepted logins must
   return `nextAction: "workflow_selection"` (the implemented handlers still emit the
   retired `active_receiving_sessions`).
4. New handlers: `tag_scan` → `tag_scan_result`, `offload_scan` → `offload_scan_result`,
   `offload_confirm` → `offload_confirm_result` (Sections 5-6). The 2.x receiving
   handlers and their topics retire with them.
5. *(3.1.0)* Document resolution on `offload_scan`: every matched result returns the
   pallet's open PO / stock transfer reference and progress (Section 6.1);
   `offload_confirm` validates the pallet against the carried reference. Post-commit
   progress on accepted confirms, and the new `offload_complete` →
   `offload_complete_result` closure handler (Section 6.4, idempotent on identical
   replay).

**Station 1 Android app:**

1. Consume `tag_scan_result` (today `tag_scan` is fire-and-forget; "Sent" reflects only
   PUBACK).
2. Replace the one-shot Bag Pairing screen (operator types all three values) with the
   Section 6 two-step Offload flow: scan tag+barcode → prefill from
   `offload_scan_result` → edit/confirm → `offload_confirm`. Wire suffixes and the
   `allowedTabs` value rename from `bag_pairing` to `offload`.
3. Await `scram_proof_result` (not `operator_context`) after the SCRAM proof
   (`AuthClient.kt`), per the shared Station 2 v4.1 authority.
4. Treat missing/empty `allowedTabs` as no workflows enabled (today the app fails open
   with both tiles enabled).
5. *(3.1.0)* Read the document fields from each `offload_scan_result`, display the number
   and progress, and repeat `documentType`/`documentNumber` on that pallet's
   `offload_confirm` and on `offload_complete` — no scanner-side document selection or
   locking. After each accepted `offload_confirm_result`, prompt "Are you done?" — Done
   opens the Short / Complete / Over choice and sends `offload_complete` for that
   document (Section 6.4); either way the scanner then returns to scanning.

## 11. Logging, redaction, and audit

For every message, diagnostic output logs direction, topic, QoS, retain, device id,
operator session id where permitted, request/response type, result/error code, and
duration. Before any diagnostic write, recursively redact sensitive properties:
`password`, `managerPassword`, `clientProof`, `serverSignature`, `authorizationToken`,
SCRAM verifier keys, broker/SAP/SQL secrets, cookies, and credentials.
`station1_processed_mqtt_messages.response_payload` never stores a raw scoped token.

## 12. Acceptance tests

- Topic/payload device matching on the five-segment namespaced topics; old-layout topics
  are not subscribed and not answered.
- Retained presence + Last Will on both base nodes; no `/status` sub-topics.
- Schema 4.1 suite unchanged: SCRAM start/proof success plus invalid, expired, used,
  replayed, and changed-body cases; plaintext credential rejection; badge login;
  replay-safe logout; secret redaction.
- Operator directory request (§4.5): accepted list carries only `username`/`displayName`;
  an unsupported station rejects it and the scanner falls back to typed usernames.
- Document completion tag counts (§6.4): short and over accepted with their count echoed;
  missing count rejected `TAG_COUNT_REQUIRED`; count under the wrong status and a count
  alongside `complete` rejected `INVALID_TAG_COUNT`; identical replay returns the recorded
  count.
- Derived device ids accepted opaquely; retired fixed ids rejected only where an enrolment
  list is configured and does not include them.
- `allowedTabs` gating: scanner enables exactly the listed workflows; station rejects a
  non-permitted workflow request with `ACTION_NOT_ALLOWED`.
- `tag_scan` → `tag_scan_result` success, `TAG_UNKNOWN`, `TAG_ALREADY_IN_USE`, and
  session-rejection paths; result echoes `tagId`.
- `offload_scan` matched (with all three prefill values), `PAIR_MISMATCH`,
  `BARCODE_NOT_FOUND`, and `TAG_ALREADY_OFFLOADED` paths.
- `offload_confirm` accepted with edited and with unchanged values; identical-confirm
  idempotent replay; conflicting-values rejection; value validation codes.
- Every matched `offload_scan` returns the pallet's open document with the Section 6.1
  fields (including pre-commit `palletsScanned`/`palletsExpected`); a pallet belonging to
  no open document is rejected with `DOCUMENT_UNKNOWN`.
- `offload_confirm`/`offload_complete` without a document reference are rejected with
  `DOCUMENT_REQUIRED`; a confirm for a pallet outside the referenced document with
  `DOCUMENT_MISMATCH`; accepted confirms carry post-commit progress.
- `offload_complete` accepted for each of `short`/`complete`/`over`, echoing `status` and
  closing the referenced document; unknown status rejected with `INVALID_PAYLOAD`;
  identical-completion idempotent replay; session-rejection paths.
- SQL failure produces no success response.

## 13. Revision history

| Version | Date | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `3.3.0` | 2026-09-18 | §6.4 short/over closures declare how many tags the receipt differs by: required `shortTagCount`/`overTagCount` on `offload_complete`, echoed on the accepted result, with new `TAG_COUNT_REQUIRED` and `INVALID_TAG_COUNT` codes. A `complete` closure still carries no count. |
| `3.2.0` | 2026-09-17 | §4.5 operator directory (`operator_list_requested` → `operator_list`) for the login dropdown: display-only usernames and display names, cached on the scanner, with a typed-username fallback when the station does not implement it. |
| `3.1.0` | 2026-08-25 | Document-aware Offload per the agreed scanner flow: every matched tag+barcode scan resolves the pallet's open purchase order / stock transfer and returns its reference and pallet progress in the scan result (Section 6.1) — no scanner-side document selection or locking; the scanner repeats `documentType`/`documentNumber` on that pallet's confirm and on completion; `palletsScanned`/`palletsExpected` on document objects and accepted confirms; "Are you done?" after each accepted confirm; new `offload_complete` → `offload_complete_result` closing the looked-up document as `short`/`complete`/`over` (Section 6.4); new `DOCUMENT_REQUIRED`/`DOCUMENT_UNKNOWN`/`DOCUMENT_MISMATCH` error codes. |
| `3.0.0` | 2026-08-25 | Stripped-down scanner contract: fleet-wide namespaced topics and base-node presence/LWT; derived unique device ids; fixed scanner roles removed in favor of login-driven `allowedTabs` (`tag_assignment`, `offload`) enforced on the scanner; new `tag_scan` and two-step `offload_scan`/`offload_confirm` workflows with backend prefill; 2.x receiving message families, broadcasts, and envelope machinery retired; SCRAM proof response confirmed as `scram_proof_result`. |
| `2.3.0` | 2026-08-25 | Android handoff release; made Station 2 schema 4.1 the shared login/session authority, added exact Android subscriptions/state/persistence rules, exact SCRAM derivation and validation behavior, corrected implemented authentication error names, documented Station 1 capability cutover status, and clarified `sapPostStatus: "Pending"`. |
| `2.2.0` | 2026-08-24 | Added duplicate-safe Scanner 2 potential shortage/over-receipt report and durable desktop Needs Action workflow. |
| `2.1.0` | 2026-08-24 | Added schema 4.1 authentication/session foundation and coordinated-migration boundary. |
| `2.0.0` | 2026-08-20 | Established fixed-row assignment, desktop Print All, staged Scanner 2 pairing, final All Pallets Offloaded gate, replay, and reconnect target. |
